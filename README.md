Although it took me part of the day because I only workd on it for 10 minutes at a time throughout the day. I felt as if I truly beginning to grasp some of the concepts I've been teaching myself for some time now. 

## Why I'm doing this project

As perhaps hundreds of other people across the interwebs wanting to leran to code I've decided to do the JavaScript30 course from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) [JavaScript30 course](https://javascript30.com/).

In honesty I've learned HTML fairly well and CSS enough to get my introuble and at several times attempted to start JavaScript but to no real end. When Wes first released his course I decided to do it *but* I could never finish it. Out of lazyness I guess. 

I know have this burning desire to be part of the thousands who've taught themselves to code and gone to gain work as a freelancer or at a tech company. What lies instore for me is unkown but what I do know is that I want to be someone **who can code.**
